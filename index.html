<p>Akiva is seeking an internship for the summer of 2015.  This profile outlines his biography and skills.</p>

<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>Akiva Lipshitz is a confident, motivated, and relentlessly-persistent 14-year old software developer and aspiring entrepreneur. His goal is to realize his potential and to create value for himself and the world.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2013, Akiva interned at elevatr, a startup in NYC whose mission he shared.  <a href="http://blog.elevatr.com/post/58699164214/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-13-year-old-intern">This article</a> was written about Akivaâ€™s internship.  That same summer, he began meeting with  entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to learn from them. During the 2013/4 school, year, Akiva established and ran an entrepreneurship club at his middle school, which he called Vectorthink (see <a href="http://jewishlinkbc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=1834:talking-business&amp;Itemid=562">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/455719197871762/">here</a>  for more).  He began discussions to export this model to other schools in the U.S. and elsewhere. At the same time, Akiva taught himself C and Objective-C using textbooks and online resources.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2014, Akiva completed <a href="http://makeschool.com/">Makeschool</a>, an intensive full-time two-month game development academy in the Flatiron District.  Akiva was the youngest participant in the academy, where many other participants where more than double his age.  During the academy, Akiva was voted by his peers to have the best elevator pitch.  Akiva developed a particularly complex iOS app,  <strong>Darklight</strong>, a game about color and movement which can be found on the app store <a href="http://bit.ly/1zzApPK">here</a>.</p>

<p>Akiva is very proud to have interned during the summer of 2014 at a leading venture capital firm, <a href="http://thrivecap.com/">Thrive Capital</a>.</p>

<p>Upon entering high school in 2014, Akiva became more committed to hardware development.  In December 2014, he participated in his first hackathon where he was the youngest participant and where he and his team emerged victorious. They <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/myopong-3hpuu">hacked the classic computer game of pong</a> using the Thalmic Myo, an EMG sensor, allowing for control of the on-screen paddle using arm movement and connected the game to Phillips Hue Smartbulbs to visualize status of the game. See more in <a href="http://jstandard.com/content/item/happy_hackathonukah/32149">this</a> article.</p>

<p>Akiva is an avid reader of books on entrepreneurship (in the past few months he has read <em>The Lean Startup</em>, <em>Zero to One</em>, and <em>The Innovators</em>).  He admires people like Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak. Akiva loves creating new things at his local makerspace, and teaches a weekly IOS development class at his school.  He is a strong advocate for education, is inspired and wants to inspire. Most importantly, Akiva reflects upon his life and challenges himself to conquer new frontiers.</p>
